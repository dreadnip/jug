# What it is not

Jug does not offer pagination or tag clouds. It does not use front-matter. It does not generate a full blog from a folder of markdown files.

It is a 1-to-1 Twig to HTML static site generator. If you want to end up with `/foo/bar/page.html`, you have to write `/foo/bar/page.twig`. You want 20 blog posts? Each post is a Twig file.

Think of it like building a HTML website by hand, with the added benefits of everything listed in the features above.
