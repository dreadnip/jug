# Jug

Jug is a very basic static site generator that turns Twig templates into straight HTML.

It uses Twig and other Symfony components, so it should feel familiar for people with Symfony experience.

## Features

* Twig-powered
* Multilang ready (symfony/translations)
* Optimized images
* Watch & serve command for quick development
* Easy, PHP based config
* Events to customize the build before & after

Take a look at [the docs](docs/README.md) for more information.

You can check out the tests/Fixture folder for a dummy example of a Jug website, or take a look at the [example repository](https://github.com/dreadnip/jug-template) to see it in use.
